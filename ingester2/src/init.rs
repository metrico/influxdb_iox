/// During initialisation of an `ingester2` instance, any files in

/// write-ahead log.
///
/// These files are read and replayed fully before this function returns.
///
/// Any error during replay is fatal.
///
/// ## Graceful Shutdown
///
/// When `shutdown` completes, the ingester blocks ingest (returning an error to
/// all new write requests) while still executing query requests. The ingester
/// then persists all data currently buffered.
///
/// Callers can wait for this buffer persist to complete by awaiting
/// [`IngesterGuard::join()`], which will resolve once all data has been flushed
/// to object storage.
///
/// The ingester will continue answering queries until the gRPC server is
/// stopped by the caller (managed outside of this crate).
///
/// ## Deferred Loading for Persist Operations
///
/// Several items within the ingester's internal state are loaded only when
/// needed at persist time; this includes string name identifiers of namespaces,
/// tables, etc that are embedded within the Parquet file metadata.
///
/// As an optimisation, these deferred loads occur in a background task before
/// the persist action actually needs them, in order to both eliminate the
/// latency of waiting for the value to be fetched, and to avoid persistence of
/// large numbers of partitions operations causing a large spike in catalog
/// requests / load.
///
/// These values are loaded a uniformly random duration of time between
/// initialisation, and at most, `persist_background_fetch_time` duration of
/// time later. By increasing this duration value the many loads are spread
/// approximately uniformly over a longer period of time, decreasing the peak
/// catalog load they cause.
///
/// If the `persist_background_fetch_time` duration is too large, they will not
/// have resolved in the background when a persist operation starts, and they
/// will require demand loading, causing an immediate catalog load spike. This
/// value should be tuned to be slightly less than the interval between persist
/// operations, but not so long that it causes catalog load spikes at persist
/// time (which can be observed by the catalog instrumentation metrics).
///
/// ##Â Hot Persistence
///
/// Partitions have a opaque estimate of the "cost" (in terms of time/space) to
/// persist the data within them. The cost calculation is made in
/// [`MutableBatch::size_data()`].
///
/// Once this cost estimation exceeds the `persist_hot_partition_cost` the
/// partition is immediately enqueued for persistence, and subsequent writes are
/// applied to a new buffer.
///
/// Increasing this value reduces the frequency of hot partition persistence,
/// but may also increase the total amount of data that needs persisting for a
/// single partition. In practice, this increases the memory utilisation of
/// datafusion during the persist compaction step.
///
/// Decreasing this value increases the frequency of persist operations, and
/// usually decreases the size of the resulting parquet files.
///
