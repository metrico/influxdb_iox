//! IOx Ingester V2 implementation.
//!
//! ## Write Reordering
//!
//! A write that enters an `ingester2` instance can be reordered arbitrarily
//! with concurrent write requests.
//!
//! For example, two gRPC writes can race to be committed to the WAL, and then
//! race again to be buffered into the [`BufferTree`]. Writes to a
//! [`BufferTree`] may arrive out-of-order w.r.t their assigned sequence
//! numbers.
//!
//! This can also lead to the ordering of entries in the [`wal`] diverging from
//! the order of ops applied to the [`BufferTree`] (see
//! <https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/issues/6276>).
//!
//! This requires careful management, but ultimately allows for high levels of
//! parallelism when handling both writes and queries, increasing the
//! performance of both.
//!
//! Because of re-ordering, ranges of [`SequenceNumber`] cannot be used to
//! indirectly equality match (nor prefix match) the underlying data;
//! non-monotonic writes means overlapping ranges do not guarantee equality of
//! the set of operations they represent (gaps may be present). For example, a
//! range of sequence numbers bounded by `[0, 2)` for thread 1 may not contain
//! the same op data as another thread T2 with range with the same bounds due to
//! reordering causing T1 to observe `{0, 1, 2}` and T2 observing `{0, 2}` and
//! after a faulty range comparison, `{1}` to converge.
//!
//! [`BufferTree`]: crate::buffer_tree::BufferTree
//! [`SequenceNumber`]: data_types::SequenceNumber
